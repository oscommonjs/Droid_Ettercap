ettercap (1:0.7.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Slightly reorganised packaging: ettercap-common holds everything
    except the actual ettercap executable.  This comes in two varieties,
    which are in ettercap-text-only and ettercap-graphical.  The latter
    has both the textual and graphical interfaces, and is thus a
    functional superset of the former.
